    <body> <h1>The design of words</h1><p><br>spun out finely, inserted into pieces of
    <br>art, telling stories akin to experience
    <br>printed with care, some wrapped in lace
    <br>some cause tears to roll down a pretty face
    <br>--
    <br>though some are cruel
    <br>most are luxurious and kind
    <br>the design of them is peculiar
    <br>yet exquisite and unique</p>
